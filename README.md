- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robert Chukwuemeka.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer with a software engineering soul, obsessed with turning ideas into seamless, scalable action.
- With 3+ years in the trenches, Iâ€™ve honed a knack for automating chaos, keeping systems purring, and turning server hiccups into lessons learned.
- Whether Iâ€™m whipping up Bash and Python scripts, fine-tuning Terraform stacks, or diving into logs to save the day, Iâ€™m all about making tech work smarterâ€”not harder.
- When Iâ€™m not glued to my terminal, youâ€™ll find me geeking out over cloud trends, sharpening my skills, or tinkering with a side project.
- Core Strengths: CI/CD Automation | Cloud Infrastructure | Containers (Docker, Kubernetes) | IaC (Terraform) | Team Player.
- Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re into taming chaosâ€”or just want to debate the latest DevOps hacks!
- ðŸ“« I am an asset to my team!
